Note that these data will **not** be sent to anybody else and that the Android device does **not** store any persistent data by any means.\r\n\r\n********************** \r\nDirectories and Projects Structure\r\n----------------------------------\r\nEach directory of the repository contains an Eclipse project that you can import into your workspace or where you feel more comfortable.\r\n\r\nDirectories and their contents:\r\n\r\n1. **`CommonDrinViewer`** contains the Eclipse project with the common Java classes used by the desktop and Android apps.\r\n2. **`DesktopDrinViewer`** contains the Eclipse project with the needed Java classes for the Desktop application. SWT Library (http://www.eclipse.org/swt/), SQLite-jdbc (https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) and SWTJar (http://mchr3k.github.io/swtjar/) for easy SWT multiplatform deployment are included in the lib folder.\r\n3. **`DroidDrinViewer`** contains the Eclipse project with the needed Java classes for the Android app. android-support-v4.jar for backward Android OS support is included in libs folder for convenience.\r\n\r\n**********************\r\nNotices\r\n-------\r\nDrinViewer is still under heavy developement, the source code is just a skeleton for further imporvements but still usable.\r\n\r\nYou'll always have the source code: I'm not asking to trust me, but look at the source to realize that nothing evil will be done with your precious contact informations. Every permission asked to the Android device is strictly related to the implementation.\r\n\r\nNo binaries are provided for time being, but you can clone the repository and compile it yourself.\r\n\r\n**********************\r\nDrinViewer is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
